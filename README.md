# Process Scheduling Simulator
The project here is used to implement some of the theoretical process scheduling policies which can be used in Operating Systems.

## Implemented scheduling policies
Currently, only 3 policies are implemented:
- First in First out (FIFO)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Multi-level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)

## Testings
Testings can be found inside `Main.java`. Junit is not used here for simplicity sake.

## Notes
Since the test results are calculated by hand, there *maybe* human errors. I used those results to verify the correctness of those policies. But rest assured, after all those painful times, the whole system should be stable.
